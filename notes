things to check out in HB app:
.env - local environment variables (including secret key, client id and db)
git ignore to see what files I shouldn't be pushing
model.py - use base, then build classes off the base
main.py - import sql alchemy and declare routes
config.py - reads from .env file through foreman OR heroku's environment variables
